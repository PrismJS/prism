<summary>Prism v1 contributing notes </summary>

Prism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, consider giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:

- **Read the Documentation** üìö: Familiarize yourself with the [extending documentation](https://prismjs.com/extending.html). Prism is designed to be extensible.
- **File Modifications** üìù: Do not edit `prism.js`; it's the version used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the `components/` folder. All minified files are generated by our build system (see below).
- **Install Dependencies** ‚öôÔ∏è: Use `npm ci` to install Prism's dependencies. Avoid `npm install`, as it may lead to non-deterministic builds.
- **Build System** üõ†Ô∏è: The build system uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to minify files and build `prism.js`. 
After installing dependencies, run:
```
  npm run build
```
- **Code Conventions** üé®: Follow the existing code conventions. For instance, use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment.

- **PR Size** üìè: Aim for smaller PRs to make merging easier. Large PRs may take longer to review and can complicate the merging process.

- **Language Definitions**üåç: If you contribute a new language definition, you will handle any related bug reports. Ensure to add your new definition to components.json and rebuild Prism.

- **Testing** üîç: Add tests for new languages and examples in the examples/ folder.

- **Theming** üé®: To add a new theme, visit prism-themes.
