Functions in Agda are PURE and TOTAL.
Different from Haskell, they can be *dependent* and they can receive implicit arguments.
Functions can be infix, or even mixfix, and they become operators.
So it is generally not possible to highlight all the "operators" as they are functions.
(Also, types are functions too, so it is generally impossible to highlight types.)
