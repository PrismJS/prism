----------------------------------------------------

"Normal" words are not builtin well-known ones like "not", "and", "<=>", though they may be in the standard library or user-defined.
They may start with any character except `"` (double-quote), but may contain or end with double-quotes or any other non-whitespace character.

Conventionally named words follow the conventions outlined in prism-factor.js.
