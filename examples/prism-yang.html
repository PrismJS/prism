		"The 'dns' component provides support for configuring the DNS resolver.

		 The 'domain' keyword of /etc/resolv.conf is not supported, since
		 it is equivalent to 'search' with a single domain. I.e. in terms
		 of the data model, the domains are always configured as 'search'
		 elements, even if there is only one. The set of available options
		 has been limited to those that are generally available across
		 different resolver implementations, and generally useful.";
