# How to use

The plugin will automatically handle missing grammars and load them for you. To do this, you need to provide a URL to a directory of all the grammars you want. This can be the path to a local directory with all grammars or a CDN URL.

You can download all the available grammars by clicking on the following link: <button class="download-grammars" type="button">download all grammars</button>.<br />
Alternatively, you can also clone the GitHub repo and take the `components` folder from there. Read our [usage section](https://prismjs.com/index.html#basic-usage-cdn) to use a CDN.

You can then download Prism core and any plugins from the [Download](https://prismjs.com/download.html) page, without checking any languages (or just check the languages you want to load by default, e.g. if you're using a language a lot, then you probably want to save the extra HTTP request).

A couple of additional options are available through the configuration object `Prism.plugins.autoloader`.

## Specifying the grammars path

By default, the plugin will look for the missing grammars in the `components` folder. If your files are in a different location, you can specify it using the `languages_path` option:

```
Prism.plugins.autoloader.languages_path = 'path/to/grammars/';
```

_Note:_ Autoloader is pretty good at guessing this path. You most likely won't have to change this path.

## Using development versions

By default, the plugin uses the minified versions of the grammars. If you wish to use the development versions instead, you can set the `use_minified` option to false:

```
Prism.plugins.autoloader.use_minified = false;
```

## Specifying additional dependencies

All default dependencies are already included in the plugin. However, there are some cases where you might want to load an additional dependency for a specific code block. To do so, just add a `data-dependencies` attribute on you `<code>` or `<pre>` tags, containing a list of comma-separated language aliases.

```markup
<pre><code class="language-pug" data-dependencies="less">
:less
	foo {
		color: @red;
	}
</code><pre>
```

## Force to reload a grammar

The plugin usually doesn't reload a grammar if it already exists. In some very specific cases, you might however want to do so. If you add an exclamation mark after an alias in the `data-dependencies` attribute, this language will be reloaded.

```html
<pre class="language-markup" data-dependencies="markup,css!"><code>
```

# Examples

Note that no languages are loaded on this page by default.

Basic usage with some Perl code:

```perl
my ($class, $filename) = @_;
```

Alias support with TypeScript's `ts`:

```ts
const a: number = 0;
```

The Less filter used in Pug:

```pug
:less
	foo {
		color: @red;
	}
```

# Markdown

Markdown will use the Autoloader to automatically load missing languages.

````markdown
The C# code will be highlighted __after__ the rest of this document.

```csharp
public class Foo : IBar<int> {
	public string Baz { get; set; } = "foo";
}
```

The CSS code will be highlighted with this document because CSS has already been loaded.

```css
a:hover {
	color: green !important;
}
```
